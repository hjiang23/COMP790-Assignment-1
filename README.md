# Why this is a game

My Assignment 1 is a basic target game in which the player must shoot the ball at the target 10 times in order to win. The player can look around in VR to aim the ball and use the button on the Google Cardboard to shoot the ball forward. If the ball hits the target, the player will gain a point and the game ends when the player scores 10 points. 

This is a game according to Juul's definition of a game, which we discussed in class. There are fixed rules; the player is confined to an area and can only look around and shoot a blue ball. There are variable and quantifiable outcomes; the player could win by scoring 10 points or theoretically lose and stop before then (although it doesn't take very long to win). There is valorization of outcome; the game pops up with a very satisfying "YOU WIN" message if the player wins. There is player effort; the player must aim at the target and hit the Cardboard button. There is attachment to outcome; the player might feel a tiny bit happier having won a trivial game. There are negotiable consequences; in this case there aren't any real world consequences but the player might have fun or be confused by a bug.

Unfortunately, my unfamiliarity with programming in Unity has led to there being bugs in this game. When I tried playing the game in Unity, the score incremented by 1, but on my phone it incremented by 2. I changed the increment to 0.5 so that in total the game adds 1, but for some reason sometimes it only adds 0.5. This bug is probably also related to why the game sometimes does not show the "YOU WIN" message.
